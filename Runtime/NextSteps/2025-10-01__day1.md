## Recommended Next Step: **Refine Unity API First**

### Primary Rationale

**Continue with Unity** because:

1. **You have working momentum** - Your sequences, RepeatForever, and actions are functional. Building on working code is more productive than starting over.

2. **Unknown validation** - You haven't validated whether your Scratch-style API actually feels good to use yet. Port after you know the design works, not before.

3. **Unity-specific refinements needed** - Your `PoliceCarScratch.cs` shows you're calling `GetComponentInChildren<Rigidbody>()` every frame in `MoveCar()`. Performance issues like this need solving regardless of engine.

4. **API surface is small** - You only have ~4-5 primitives working. The cost of porting later is low; the risk of premature porting is high.

### Specific Refinements to Prioritize

Before considering a port, address these:

1. **Cache component references** - Don't fetch components per frame
2. **Add more control flow** - `If`, `IfElse`, `RepeatUntil`, `Forever`
3. **Test nesting complexity** - Can you nest sequences inside RepeatForever inside conditions?
4. **MonoBehaviour lifecycle** - How do sequences handle `OnDestroy`, scene changes, or object disabling?
5. **Parallel sequences** - Your light blinking runs separate from movement—formalize this pattern

## Alternative: Port to Godot (Not Recommended Yet)

### When to Consider Godot

Port when:
- ✅ Your Unity API feels polished and intuitive
- ✅ You've built 2-3 complete behaviors with it
- ✅ You have concrete performance/design insights
- ✅ You want to validate engine-agnostic architecture

### Risks of Early Port
- Divides focus between two incomplete implementations
- May discover design flaws that require rework in both engines
- Godot's GDScript/C# integration differs significantly from Unity's

---

## Alternative Suggestion: **Hybrid Approach**

If you're eager to validate portability:

1. **Extract pure C# core** - Move FSM logic (your `IStep` interfaces) to a separate `.csproj` with zero Unity dependencies
2. **Keep Unity wrapper thin** - Only `MonoBehaviour` glue stays Unity-specific
3. **Prototype Godot bootstrap** - Spend 1-2 hours wiring your core library to Godot's `Node` system as a feasibility test
4. **Return to Unity** - Continue primary development there with confidence your architecture ports cleanly

This validates portability without fragmenting your workflow.

---

## Bottom Line

**Stay in Unity for now.** Your next 5-10 hours should focus on:
- Fixing performance issues (caching components)
- Expanding control flow primitives
- Building 1-2 more complex examples beyond the police car

Port to Godot once you have a battle-tested API you're proud of.
