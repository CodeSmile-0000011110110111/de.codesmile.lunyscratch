Based on your progress, here's what I recommend:

## **Recommended: Get UnrealSharp Test Working**

You're in a unique "pioneer" position with three engines—finish validating that your architecture actually works across all of them **before** diving deeper into any single engine.

### Why This Makes Sense Now

1. **You've proven portability twice** - Godot and Unity both work. Getting UnrealSharp compiling suggests your core design is sound.

2. **Validation is cheap now** - You don't need a complex test. Just instantiate a sequence with one action and call `Step()` in a tick. That proves the integration layer works.

3. **Architecture risk is higher than feature risk** - If UnrealSharp reveals a fundamental incompatibility (threading model, lifecycle hooks, etc.), you want to know *now*, not after spending weeks on Unity features.

4. **AI limitation doesn't matter for this** - You already know the pattern from Unity/Godot. You just need to wire up:
    - A wrapper similar to `UnityEngineObject.cs`
    - An update/tick callback to call `sequence.Step()`
    - A simple action (move object, print debug text, etc.)

### Tomorrow's Task (2-3 hours max)

Create a minimal proof-of-concept:

```csharp
// UnrealEngineObject.cs (or similar)
public sealed class UnrealEngineObject : IGameEngineObject
{
    private readonly UObject _engineObject; // Or AActor, UActorComponent, etc.
    
    public void SetEnabled(bool enabled)
    {
        // Whatever UnrealSharp's API is
    }
}

// Simple test in an Actor's Tick:
public override void Tick(float deltaTime)
{
    _sequence?.Step(deltaTime); 
}
```


**Success criteria**: One sequence runs one action (e.g., print "Hello from Unreal" 5 times). That's it.

## **If UnrealSharp Frustrates You (Fallback Plan)**

Switch to **Unity API refinement** (per your day1.md notes):

1. Cache component references in `PoliceCarScratch`
2. Add `If`/`IfElse` control flow
3. Build a second, different behavior (enemy patrol? collectible spawner?)

But given you're *this close* to proving three-engine compatibility, I'd push through the UnrealSharp test first.

## **Bottom Line**

✅ **Do tomorrow**: Get a trivial UnrealSharp sequence working (2-3 hours)  
⏭️ **After that**: Return to Unity for deeper features  
❌ **Don't do**: Abandon UnrealSharp at 90% validation

You're collecting rare data about cross-engine architecture. Finish the experiment.

## Understanding the UnrealSharp Issue
You're correct—UnrealSharp exposes Blueprint-compatible APIs, not raw C++ Unreal APIs. AI models trained on C++ Unreal documentation will suggest `AActor::SetActorLocation()` style methods that don't exist in the C# wrapper. This is frustrating but expected for newer tooling.
**Your instinct is right**: get the minimal test working to prove integration, then move on. The showcase value is real—cross-engine scripting libraries are rare.
