**Expected output**: After 1.5 seconds, logs "âœ“ Counter reached 3!"
### Key Design Notes
1. **Evaluate once per If/IfElse execution** - Don't re-check the condition while the branch is running. This matches Scratch behavior.
2. **Reset both branches** - Even though only one executes, reset both in `Reset()` to handle sequences that loop.
3. **Lambda conditions are convenient** - But offer concrete implementations for complex/reusable logic (distance checks, health thresholds, etc.).
4. **Nesting works naturally** - Your `IStep` abstraction already handles this. An can contain a `Sequence` containing another . `If``If`

Good luck with UnrealSharp tomorrow! The conditional work will be waiting when you return to Unity.
